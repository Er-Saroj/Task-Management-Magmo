# FastAPI Task Management Server Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides instructions on how to set up and run a FastAPI server designed for managing tasks. The server supports several operations including creating tasks individually or in bulk, retrieving all tasks or a specific one by its ID, updating tasks, and deleting them.

## Features

- **Create Task**: Add a new task with details such as title, status, priority, and description.
- **Bulk Create Tasks**: Simultaneously add multiple tasks.
- **Retrieve Tasks**: Fetch all existing tasks or a single task by ID.
- **Update Task**: Modify details of an existing task.
- **Delete Task**: Remove an existing task from the system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository where the project is hosted. Replace `yourusername` and `your-repository` with the actual GitHub username and repository name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated environments for them.

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Running the Server

To run the server, use Uvicorn with `reload` enabled to allow for automatic reloads on code changes. This is particularly useful during development.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This command assumes your FastAPI application is defined in a file named `main.py` with an instance named `app`.

## API Endpoints

Describe each API endpoint including the HTTP method, path, expected request body, and the response body.

### Create a Task

- **Method**: POST
- **Endpoint**: `/tasks/`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Task Title",
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": 1,
    "description": "Description here"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "generated-uuid",
    "title": "Task Title",
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": 1,
    "timestamp": "timestamp-here",
    "description": "Description here"
  }
  ```

### Retrieve Tasks

- **Method**: GET
- **Endpoint**: `/tasks/`
- **Response**: A list of tasks.

### Update Task

- **Method**: PUT
- **Endpoint**: `/tasks/{task_id}`
- **Body** and **Response**: Similar to creating a task.

### Delete Task

- **Method**: DELETE
- **Endpoint**: `/tasks/{task_id}`
- **Response**: Details of the deleted task.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a robust system for task management using FastAPI. Adjust the repository and file references as per your project's actual configuration.
